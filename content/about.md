Hi, I'm currently computer science student at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia and 
will be graduating in May '19.

At the moment I intern at [BrickSimple](https://bricksimple.com) and am a third year resident 
assistant. This year I was hand-picked to serve as the freshman male emerging leaders RA where I 
facilitate them through the transition from high school to college and assist them in 
searching for leadership roles on campus.

In my spare time I enjoy 3D printing, programming, playing with electronics, and reading. My main 
interests in computer science are AI and computer vision.
