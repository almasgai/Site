Hello world! This my first article on my Hugo-powered blog! The purpose of this blog to is periodically update recruiters on CS related projects. 

I decided I wanted a simple, lightweight blogging site. I chose to use Hugo for its ease of use and speed. By opting for Hugo my website does not use a database making faster and more secure. As for the Hugo theme I chose Tales. For hosting, I chose to use Github Pages.
