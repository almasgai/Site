## Solving a Common College Student Problem:

Like most people, I enjoy sleep. A lot. Maybe too much. Waking up early in the
morning is a herculean task for me because I'm a heavy sleeper. But I'm also taking an 8 am
class this semester and don't want to sleep in. I decided that between my knowledge on
programming and electronics, I could somehow solve my problem.

I had my 'eureka' moment about two weeks ago while watching a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlMtakaa7u8)
on creating flexible LED panels. I thought that waking up would be easier if
I could have one of these turn on above my bed in the morning so that I could
wake up. I estimated that my idea would cheap, feasible, and very useful everyday
of my life, plus I might learn something new. This is where my quest to waking
up earlier easier begins!

## Parts List
Below are all the parts I used, most of which are similar to what you can find
in the video

- [LED Light Strip](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HSF64JG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1): Personally I chose to use 'warm' white to emulate natural
sunlight
- [Fake Leather](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JLPQKFO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1): Used this as the panel since pleather is flexible, strong, and inexpensive!
- [Power Source](https://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Arduino-Tbuymax-Listed-Positive/dp/B06Y1LF8T5/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1519933043&sr=8-3&keywords=arduino+power+supply&dpID=51%252BmVpNs4eL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch): Used to power the Arduino and light panel.
- [MOSFET](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CHTLAIS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1): Used to control the 12V LED lights. Using this allows the Arduino to pump
out more electricity to the lights without frying the Arduino board when using a
12V power supply. The LED lights still work using at 75% power using the power
supply above. I used the power supply listed above because it was something that I
already had in my room and was satisfied with how bright it was.
- [Aluminum Wire](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B0Y06SA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s05?ie=UTF8&psc=1):
This is used to help the panel maintain its form. The wires are easy to bend, but
hard to break. Perfect for the panel.

Miscellaneous parts that most electronic enthusiasts already have:

- Soldering Iron
- Solder Wire
- Red(+) & Black(-) Wire
- Wire Cutter
- Smoke Fan with Carbon Filter
- Hot Glue Gun

After gathering all the parts, I got down to work!

## First Things First
I wanted to make my panel rectangular so that when the light shines at 7 in the
morning, it would cover my entire field of vision and (hopefully) wake up. I
decided to make each strip 18 LED lights long. I then cut pleather to make a
lightweight, flexible panel panel.

It wasn't too long until I hit my first roadblock,
which was soldering. I found the culprit, or should I say culprits. The first problem
was I placed the LED light strips too close together. Originally this was what I
wanted so that when the lights turned on, the concentration of light would be very
bright as opposed to having the strips widely dispersed in a way that the concentration
of light would be weak. Having the LED strips and wires so close together caused
the red and black wires to touch in some instances and cut the electric circuit
short. The end result was that only some LED strips remained lit and those that
did usually flickered.

The second issue was the red and black wires were too stiff and wouldn't stay bent
since the I was bending them too sharply. This caused the thick wires to literally
*rip* the soldering wire metal off of the LED light panels, cutting the circuit
short.

I rearranged space between the strips so that 1) soldering the wires together
became much easier, 2) the positive and negative wires wouldn't touch and accidentally
cut the circuit short, 3) bending the positive and negative wires wouldn't be under
enough stress to rip the metal off the strips again and 4) to provide a larger area
of light output while making sure the light output was strong enough to wake me
up.

## Let There Be Light!
I held my breath while I plugged the power supply into the socket... and it worked!
Or at least the first three rows. The positive and negative wires were soldered
together on the fourth row by accident that cut the circuit short. Whoops. After
resoldering, everything worked perfectly.

My next step was to add the aluminum wire to the panel. This would allow the
flimsy panel to hold its form when manipulating it. This was accomplished by
cutting the wire slightly shorted than the perimeter of the panel. I then used
a hot glue gun to make the aluminum wires stayed put. Lastly, I folded the fake leather
over aluminum wire so that it was hidden. Again, I used a hot glue gun to keep
this leather down so that the wiring would remain concealed.

I then made slits where the strips ended on the opposite end of where the
soldering of wires was done. This helped hide where the positive and negative ends were
exposed. I also made a small cut where the power adapter was and threaded the
power adapter through the hole so that it would remain hidden from the front view.

After testing out the lights one last time to ensure that everything was working,
I switched over to the software side of things.

Keeping my costs down was my number one priority. Originally, I thougt about using
an STM32 but I already had a spare Arduino Uno laying around so I thought it was
about time putting it to use. I had also considered using an Arduino Mega2560 as
well but thought it would be a little bit overkill since has more I/O pins than
I know what to do with and more horsepower necessary for this particular project,
so I settled with the Uno.

Programming it was straightforward. I needed to get acquainted with two libraries:
[TimeLib](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time) & [TimeAlarms](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimeAlarms). TimeLib is used for timekeeping functionality, which would
help me keep track of the time that has passed between each day. TimeAlarms would
allow the Arduino to do a specific task based on what time it is. The documentation
for each respective library was straightforward and easy to follow. Along with
[Adafruit's guide on LED strips](https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-strips?view=all),
I was able to write up a relatively simple program below:

```Arduino
#include <TimeLib.h>
#include <TimeAlarms.h>

#define PIN 10            // control pin
#define DELAY 10          // 20ms internal delay; increase for slower fades

int long countDown = 1800 * 1000;

void setup() {

  pinMode(PIN, OUTPUT);

  // Setting time format (24 hour):
  // HOUR, MINS, SECS, MONTH, DAY, YEAR (20XX)
  setTime(00, 13, 00, 3, 1, 18);

  // Setting up when the alarm should go off
  Alarm.alarmRepeat(6, 45, 00, fade);


}

void loop() {
  Alarm.delay(1000); // wait one second between clock display
}

void fade() {

while(countDown != 0){

  delay(1000);
    // fade in
    for(int i=0; i< 255; i++) {
      analogWrite(PIN, i);
      delay(DELAY);
    }

    // fade out
    for(int i=0; i< 255; i++) {
      analogWrite(PIN, 255 - i);
      delay(DELAY);
    }

    countDown -= 5000;
  }

  countDown = 2700 * 1000;
  analogWrite(PIN, LOW);
}
```

## Piecing Things Together
My next step was bringing the project together. I connected pin 9 (PWM) to the source
of the MOSFET. It is important to use a pin with a tilde(~) next to it. These pins
support [pulse width modulation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM) which allow
the light to dim the LED lights by getting analog results with digital means. Of
course, one can have it so that the lights turn on as bright as they can without
the pulsating fading effect but I opted for these effects because I thought it
would be easier to wake up to. To each their own for lighting methods!

I then connected this pin to the source terminal of the MOSFET by soldering the
ends together using some soldering wire. This was a little tedious since I had to
solder outside (no soldering allowed in the residence hall) in 40Â° weather where
the soldering wire was reluctant to melt and was even more reluctant keep this
composition while I managed to merge the two ends together. After more attempts
than I would like to admit, I finally got it.

Next I decided to solder the gate terminal to a jumper wire connected to negative
wire that directly fed into the negative end of the LED lights. I then connected
drain terminal to the GND pin on the Arduino. Lastly, I connected the positive red
wire from the LED strip to the VIN pin which powers the panel with 9V of electricity.

## Tying Up the Loose Ends

From a functional stand point, my product worked and was 100% complete. Structurally
speaking, there was still work left to be done. I wanted to suspend my LED panel
above my bed but initially had no clear way of doing it so I eventually decided to
create loops out of my pleather that I would thread with some cheap string. I held
down the loops using my hot glue gun and was able to suspend it all with string
that was connected to a nail above my bed.

My wiring was a little hectic so I decided to use zip ties to organize them better.
I then glued my Arduino to the back of the LED panel so it was out of sight and
securely attached to the back side that you can see in the picture above.

## Conclusion
Overall, I learned a lot through this project. I had recently began looking for
ways in my own life to solve any problems I might have through technology and I
accomplished my goal. I explored two new and very practical libraries that may
come handy somewhere down the line and I few like I have a pretty solid understanding
of basic electronics. Now waking up isn't so bad and I won't be sleeping in anymore
8am classes, at least I hope not!
