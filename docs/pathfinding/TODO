Implement remaining algorithms

Create a path after finding algorithm
Add event listener to give time and space complexity
in big O and theta when selecting algorithm

Add weight functionality

Make sure clearing the grid remove grid values, not just colors

Remove redundant code with `this`:
- priority queue probably doesn't need to be passed queue ever

Replace janky grid system with node-based system
