      <description>Building an Arduino-powered Car for CSC 315 This semester I took a class that I have wanted to take since my first semester at college: CSC 315, Software Engineering. CSC 315 focuses more on the practical side of computer science as opposed to the theoretical stuff like data structures and algorithms. The first half of the semester was learning about software engineering approaches, how to work with teams when developing software, and computer ethics.</description>

      <description>I built this website using basic HTML, CSS, JS, and the Bootstrap framework. The particles on the homepage where created using open source software particle.js. Looking back at it, using Bootstrap was completely overkill for this project since I only used for its 12 grid system. A more appropriate CSS framework would have been Skeleton, which I might migrate to in the near future.
In order to create blog posts, I had to learn how to use static site generator Hugo.</description>
