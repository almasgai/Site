      <description>Solving a Common College Student Problem: Like most people, I enjoy sleep. A lot. Maybe too much. Waking up early in the morning is a herculean task since I&amp;rsquo;m a heavy sleeper. But I&amp;rsquo;m also taking an 8am class this semester and don&amp;rsquo;t want to sleep in. I decided that between my knowledge on programming and electronics, I could somehow solve my problem.
I had my &amp;lsquo;eureka&amp;rsquo; moment about two weeks ago while watching a YouTube video on creating flexible LED panels.</description>

      <description>Building an Arduino-powered Car for CSC 315: This semester I took a class that I have wanted to take since my first semester at college: CSC 315, Software Engineering. CSC 315 focuses more on the practical side of computer science as opposed to the theoretical stuff like data structures and algorithms. The first half of the semester was learning about software engineering approaches, how to work with teams when developing software, and computer ethics.</description>
