Create a path after finding algorithm

Add event listener to give time and space complexity
in big O and theta when selecting algorithm

Remove redundant code with `this`:
- priority queue probably doesn't need to be passed queue ever

Replace janky grid system with node-based system

Two adjacent weighted squares halt the Dijkstra

Moving a weighted square removes destination node

Add start and destination properties to node

Create a function that creates the grid with nodes

Nodes are being re-added to the priority queue even if they're already in there
